F = Flag bit to indicate if the item needs to be tracked during deserialization.
    The offset of the tag byte should be remembered, so that it can be referenced
    later.

* Dealing with self referential and cyclic structures:
While dumping any item with a refcount>1 (including weakrefs) the offset of the tag
needs to be tracked. The items F flag is NOT set. Should the item later be encountered
during dumping an alias or ref item will be generated with the offset in a varint, and
the F flag will be set. 

* Handling objects
During dumping the dumper is expected to maintain a mapping of class name to id. Whenever
it encounters a new class name it emits a "declare class tag" and then emits the appropriate
ref tag with the "is class" bit set.
   
* Varints
Varints are variable length integers where the high bit of each segment (normally a byte
but in some cases less) indicates if there is another byte to follow, with the bytes in 
least significant order first.
