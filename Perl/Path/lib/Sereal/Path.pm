=head1 NAME

Sereal::Path - set of tools to work with serialized Sereal documents

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sereal::Path consists of following tools:

=over 4

=item L<Sereal::Path::Iterator> - a way to iterate over serialized Sereal
documents and decode them partly. This module is foundation of all others.

=item L<Sereal::Path::Tie> - a tied interface for accessing parts of serialized
document.

=item L<Sereal::Path> - a query language for Sereal. It's similar to XPath or
JSONPath.

=head2 Synopsis

  use Sereal::Path;
  use Sereal::Encoder qw/encode_sereal/;
  
  my $data = [ { foo => 'bar' }, { foo => 'barbar' } ];
  my $sp = Sereal::Path->new(encode_sereal($data));
  
  # $result will contain { foo => 'bar' }
  my $result = $sp->traverse('$[0]');

  # $result1 will contain [ 'bar', 'barbar' ]
  my $result1 = $sp->traverse('$[*][foo]');

=head2 Description

Sereal::Path for Sereal is the same as XPath for XML or JSONPath for JSON.
Sereal::Path can directly work with encoded Sereal document. In other words,
there is no need to decode a document before executing queries against it.

As of first public release of Sereal::Path, it's considered to be in beta phase
and is not ready for production usage.

Sereal::Path derived it query syntax from JSONPath. Its documentation can be
found at L<http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/>.

However, Sereal::Path supports a subset of JSONPath. Below is the comparasion
between XPath, JSONPath and Sereal::Path:

  XPath           JSONPath            Sereal::Path            Description
  /               $                   $                       The root object/element
  .               @                   not impl                The current object/element
  /               . or []             . or []                 Child operator
  ..              n/a                 n/a                     Parent operator
  //              ..                  not impl                Recursive descent. JSONPath borrows this syntax from E4X.
  *               *                   *                       Wildcard. All objects/elements regardless their names.
  @               n/a                 n/a                     Attribute access. JSON structures don't have attributes.
  []              []                  []                      Subscript operator. XPath uses it to iterate over element
                                                              collections and for predicates. In Javascript and JSON it
                                                              is the native array operator.
  |               [,]                 [,]                     Union operator in XPath results in a combination of node sets.
                                                              JSONPath allows alternate names or array indices as a set.
  n/a             [start:end:step]    [start:end:step]        Array slice operator borrowed from ES4.
  []              ?()                 not impl                Applies a filter (script) expression.
  n/a             ()                  not impl                Script expression, using the underlying script engine.
  ()              n/a                 n/a                     Grouping in Xpath

Items which are marked as 'not impl' will be implemented at later stages of the project.

=head2 Important

Sereal::Path is still under development. It's possible that API will be change at any moment.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGMENT

This module was inspired by JSON::Path module by Toby Inkster which is a port
of the PHP JSONPath implementation (version 0.8.x) by Stefan Goessner.
See L<http://code.google.com/p/jsonpath/>.

This module was originally developed for Booking.com.  With approval from
Booking.com, this module was generalized and published on CPAN, for which the
authors would like to express their gratitude.
