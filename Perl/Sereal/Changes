Revision history for Perl extension Sereal

Sereal is a dependency package that pulls in the real Sereal::Encoder
and Sereal::Decoder.  For the actual changes between Sereal releases,
please see the Encoder and Decoder changelogs:
   * https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/Perl/Decoder/Changes
   * https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/Perl/Encoder/Changes

****************************************************************
* Warning: For a seamless upgrade, upgrade to version 4        *
*          of the decoder before upgrading to version 4 of the *
*          encoder! This may mean you should NOT install the   *
*          Sereal package and instead install the Encoder or   *
*          Decoder independently.                              *
****************************************************************
4.004 Sun Nov 12
    * Fix build issues from C++ style comments

    * Do not compress using Snappy if the buffer is larger 2**32
    * Build fixes

4.001_001 Mon Feb  6 11:13:40 CEST 2017
  * Sereal v4 release with Zstandard compression support
    https://github.com/facebook/zstd

3.015 Thu Sep  1 20:18:44 CEST 2016
  * Fix builds under 5.25+
  * Fix various buffer overun bugs found using AFL (thanks to dgryski)
  * Fix issue in decode_from_file()

3.014 Dec  7 2015
  * Fix builds under 5.8.9

3.012 Dec  6 2015
  * Yet another release related to broken META files. 
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker and CPAN::Meta need to be up to date
    or the META files miss stuff.

3.011 Dec  6 2015
  * No significant changes. Doc typo fixes, and build tweaks.

3.010 Nov 30 2015
  * Fix silly build issue for Sereal. We do some magic so that things
    "Just Work" when building from withing the git repo, but that magic
    was failing due to a precedence issue in the magic detection logic.
    This mean that users building in a git based .cpan dir would see
    breakage.

3.009 Nov 30 2015
  * Re-relase 3.008 with updated META files.

3.008 Nov 27 2015
  * [ENCODER] FIX: Make sure that reserializing a data structure created
    using alias_varint_under does not produce a corrupted dataset.
    Thanks to Iskra for the report.
  * [ENCODER] FIX: Precedence issue related to sort keys options.
    Thanks to Petr Písař <ppisar@redhat.com> for the report and fix.
  * [ENCODER/DECODER] FIX: Win32 build issues.

3.007 Nov 26 2015
  * [DECODER] Build fixes for boxes without any Sereal installed (it seems
    to be common on certain types of smokers, and not on others).
  * [ENCODER]: Base sort order changed, new sort orders added.
    Rework sort logic to be more efficient, fix sorted tied hashes,
    define new sort order.
    See Sereal::Encoders CHANGES files.
  * [ENCODER] Handle PVLV undefs
  * [ENCODER] General optimizations.
  * [ENCODER] Build fixes for 5.8.9
  * [ENCODER] Doc patches
  * Win32 build fixes.

3.006 Nov 14 2015
  * [DECODER] fix segfaults from heavily corrupted data. Guards
    against various pathological cases which could cause segfaults
    fixed. Thanks to Damian Gryski and "fuzzing sereal with afl"
    for finding these cases.
  * [ENCODER] Various subtle fixes to how we choose whether to serialize
    the string or numeric version of a value, in particular to
    ensure that "00" always round trips as "00", and related issues.
    Note this fix has correctness and performance consequences. In
    some cases values that used to serialized as integers (arguably
    incorrectly) will be serialized as strings instead, and some code
    maybe be slower to serialize.
    NOTE: Some issues related to this subject are not fixable without
    a protocol change. In particular this change may affect the behavior
    of code that uses binary logical operators on values serialized
    with Perl.
    Thanks to Zefram, Tom, and others for help with this issue.
  * Fixups for cast warnings under -Wint-to-ptr builds by using
    using PTR2INT and INT2PTR for casting our objects.
  * Win32 fixes
  * Build improvements
  * Changes to how we generate constants

3.005 Jan 05 2015
  * Build improvements related to char signedness being platform
    dependent.

3.004 Dec 27 2014
  * Performance optimizations and other miscellaneous changes.
  * Build improvements.
  * Win32 fixes for weakrefs.

3.003 Oct 19 2014
  * Niko Tyni fixed the 64-bit big endian Sereal bug! (Yay Niko!)
  * Setup META.yml correctly so that certain dependencies are
    marked as being test dependencies and not build or run-time
    dependencies.
  * Allow one to build against an externally supplied version
    of csnappy or miniz. Thanks to Petr Písař <ppisar@redhat.com>

3.002 Aug 20 2014
  Summary of changes from 3.001 - 3.002
  - Encoder: Introduce "canonical" option to encoder
  - Encoder: Introduce "canonical_refs" option to encoder
  - Decoder: Introduce "set_readonly" option to decoder
  - Decooder: Introduce "set_readonly_scalars" option to decoder

  * Decoder Bug fixes
  - Fix assertion fails in DEBUG perls (Brian Fraser)
  - Fix segfault with "into" interface when decoding references and
    strings into the same target SV. See new test t/550_decode_into.t

  * Test Infra Changes
  - Split up bulk tests to speed up testing and make it easier
    to see when a failure is restricted to a specific option.

  * Big-Endian Support
  - Improved support for Big-Endian machines. We now build and pass test
    on Sparc and HP-UX and other platforms with big-endian or strict
    alignedness requirements. Much thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi,
    Gregor Herrmann, and H. Merijn Brand for for their assistance with
    this.
  - We still have issues with s390x (Z/Os) with Sereal. If someone wants
    to help it would be appreciated.

3.001
  - Production release 1 of protocol version 3
  - Zlib support
  - CANONICAL_UNDEF,
  - new magic header to make it easier to detect
    UTF8 encoded data.
  - Minor changes to how scalar values are serialized
    to favour more compact representations.
