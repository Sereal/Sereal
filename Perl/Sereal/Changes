  Summary of changes from 3.001 - 3.002
  - Encoder: Introduce "canonical" option to encoder
  - Encoder: Introduce "canonical_refs" option to encoder
  - Decoder: Introduce "set_readonly" option to decoder
  - Decooder: Introduce "set_readonly_scalars" option to decoder

  * Decoder Bug fixes
  - Fix assertion fails in DEBUG perls (Brian Fraser)
  - Fix segfault with "into" interface when decoding references and
    strings into the same target SV. See new test t/550_decode_into.t

  * Test Infra Changes
  - Split up bulk tests to speed up testing and make it easier
    to see when a failure is restricted to a specific option.

  * Big-Endian Support
  - Improved support for Big-Endian machines. We now build and pass test
    on Sparc and HP-UX and other platforms with big-endian or strict
    alignedness requirements. Much thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi,
    Gregor Herrmann, and H. Merijn Brand for for their assistance with
    this.
  - We still have issues with s390x (Z/Os) with Sereal. If someone wants
    to help it would be appreciated.

3.001
  - Production release 1 of protocol version 3
  - Zlib support
  - CANONICAL_UNDEF,
  - new magic header to make it easier to detect
    UTF8 encoded data.
  - Minor changes to how scalar values are serialized
    to favour more compact representations.
