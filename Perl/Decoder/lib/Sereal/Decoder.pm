=head1 NAME

Sereal::Decoder - Fast, compact, powerful binary deserialization

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Sereal::Decoder qw(decode_sereal looks_like_sereal);
  
  my $decoder = Sereal::Decoder->new({...options...});
  
  my $structure;
  $decoder->decode($blob, $structure); # deserializes into $structure
  
  # or if you don't have references to the top level structure, this works, too:
  $structure = $decoder->decode($blob);
  
  # alternatively functional interface:
  decode_sereal($blob, {... options ...}, $structure);
  $structure = decode_sereal($blob, {... options ...});
  
  # Not a full validation, but just a quick check for a reasonable header:
  my $is_likely_sereal = looks_like_sereal($some_string);
  # or:
  $is_likely_sereal = $decoder->looks_like_sereal($some_string);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<This is an experimental module. The interface may change without notice.
Before using it in production, please get in touch with the authors!>

This library implements a deserializer for an efficient, compact-output,
and feature-rich binary protocol called I<Sereal>.
Its sister module L<Sereal::Encoder> implements an encoder for this format.
The two are released separately to allow for independent and safer upgrading.

The Sereal protocol version that is compatible with this decoder implementation
is currently protocol version 1. As it stands, it will refuse to attempt to
decode future versions of the protocol, but there is likely going to be an
option to decode the parts of the input that are compatible with version 1
of the protocol. The protocol was designed to allow for this.

The protocol specification and many other bits of documentation
can be found in the github repository. Right now, the specification is at
L<https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/sereal_spec.pod>,
there is a discussion of the design objectives in
L<https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/README.pod>, and the output
of our benchmarks can be seen at
L<https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/wiki/Sereal-Comparison-Graphs>.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new

Constructor. Optionally takes a hash reference as first parameter. This hash
reference may contain any number of options that influence the behaviour of the
encoder. These options are currently valid:

=over 2

=item refuse_snappy

If set, the decoder will refuse Snappy-compressed input data. This can be
desirable for robustness. See the section C<ROBUSTNESS> below.

=item refuse_objects

If set, the decoder will refuse deserializing any objects in the input stream and
instead throw and exception. Defaults to off. See the section C<ROBUSTNESS> below.

=item validate_utf8

If set, the decoder will refuse invalid UTF-8 byte sequences. This is off
by default, but it's strongly encouraged to be turned on if you're dealing
with any data that has been encoded by an external source (e.g. http cookies).

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 decode

Given a byte string of Sereal data, the C<decode> call derializes that data
structure. The result can be obtained in one of two ways: C<decode> accepts
a second parameter, which is a scalar to write the result to, AND C<decode>
will return the resulting data structure.

The two are subtly different in case of data structures that contain
references to the root element. In that case, the return value will be
a (non-recursive) copy of the reference. The pass-in style is more correct.
In other words,

  $decoder->decode($sereal_string, my $out);
  # is almost the same but safer than:
  my $out = $decoder->decode($sereal_string);

This is an unfortunate side-effect of perls standard copy semantics of
assignment. Possibly one day we will have an alternative to this.

=head2 decode_with_offset

Same as the C<decode> method, except as second parameter, you must
pass an integer offset into the input string, at which the decoding is
to start. The optional "pass-in" style scalar (see C<decode> above)
is relegated to being the third parameter.

=head2 bytes_consumed

After using the C<decode> method, C<bytes_consumed> can return the
number of bytes of the input string that were actually consumed by
the decoder. That is, if you append random garbage to a valid
Sereal document, C<decode> will happily decode the data and ignore the
garbage. If that is an error in your use case, you can use C<bytes_consumed>
to catch it.

  my $out = $decoder->decode($sereal_string);
  if (length($sereal_string) != $decoder->bytes_consumed) {
    die "Not all input data was consumed!";
  }

Chances are that if you do this, you're violating UNIX philosophy
in "be strict in what you emit but lenient in what you accept".

You can also use this to deserialize a list of Sereal documents that
is concatenated into the same string (code not very robust...):

  my @out;
  my $pos = 0;
  eval {
    while (1) {
      push @out, $decoder->decode_with_offset($sereal_string, $pos);
      $pos += $decoder->bytes_consumed;
      last if $pos >= length($sereal_string)
           or not $decoder->bytes_consumed;
    }
  };

=head2 looks_like_sereal

Given a string (or undef), checks whether it looks like it starts
with a valid Sereal packet. This is not a full-blown validation.
Instead, this just checks the magic string and some header properties
to provide a quick and efficient way to distinguish multiple well-formed
serialization methods instead of really making sure it's valid Sereal.
For reference, sereal's magic string is a four byte string C<=srl>.

=head1 EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS

=head2 decode_sereal

The functional interface that is equivalent to using C<new> and C<decode>.
Expects a byte string to deserialize as first argument, optionally followed
by a hash reference of options (see documentation for C<new()>). Finally,
C<decode_sereal> supports a third parameter, which is the output scalar
to write to. See the documentation for C<decode> above for details.

The functional interface is marginally slower than the OO interface since
it cannot reuse the decoder object.

=head2 looks_like_sereal

Same as the object method of the same name.

=head1 ROBUSTNESS

This implementation of a Sereal decoder tries to be as robust to invalid
input data as reasonably possible. This means that it should never
(though read on) segfault. It may, however, cause a large malloc
to fail. Generally speaking, invalid data should cause a Perl-trappable
exception. The one exception is that for Snappy-compressed Sereal documents,
the Snappy library may cause segmentation faults (invalid reads orwrites).
This should only be a problem if you do not checksum your data (internal
checksum support is a To-Do) or if you accept data from potentially
malicious sources.

It requires a lot of run-time boundary checks to prevent decoder
segmentation faults on invalid data. We implemented them in the
lightest way possible. Adding robustness against running out of memory
would cause an very significant run-time overhead. In most cases of
random garbage (with valid header no less) when a malloc() fails due
to invalid data, the problem was caused by a very large array or
string length. This kind of very large malloc can then fail, being
trappable from Perl. Only when packet causes many repeated allocations
do you risk causing a hard OOM error from the kernel that cannot be
trapped because Perl may require some small allocations to succeed
before the now-invalid memory is released. It is at least not entirely
trivial to craft a Sereal document that causes this behaviour.

Finally, deserializing proper objects is potentially a problem because
classes can define a destructor. Thus, the data fed to the decoder can
cause the (deferred) execution of any destructor in your application.
That's why the C<refuse_objects> option exists. Later on, we may or may
not provide a facility to whitelist classes.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

The exact performance in time and space depends heavily on the data structure
to be serialized. For ready-made comparison scripts, see the
F<author_tools/bench.pl> and F<author_tools/dbench.pl> programs that are part
of this distribution. Suffice to say that this library is easily competitive
in both time and space efficiency with the best alternatives.

=head1 THREAD-SAFETY

C<Sereal::Decoder> is thread-safe on Perl's 5.8.7 and higher. This means
"thread-safe" in the sense that if you create a new thread, all
C<Sereal::Decoder> objects will become a reference to undef in the new
thread. This might change in a future release to become a full clone
of the decoder object.
