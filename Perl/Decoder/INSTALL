Install with

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make instal

By default the module will detect and use system versions of the miniz
and csnappy libraries during build and install. You can override this
by setting the SEREAL_USE_BUNDLED_LIBS to true, or you can override
it on a case by case basis by setting SEREAL_USE_BUNDLED_MINIZ or
SEREAL_USE_BUNDLED_CSNAPPY env vars. Eg:

    SEREAL_USE_BUNDLED_LIBS=1 perl Makefile.PL
    SEREAL_USE_BUNDLED_CSNAPPY=1 perl Makefile.PL
    SEREAL_USE_BUNDLED_MINIZ=1 perl Makefile.PL
