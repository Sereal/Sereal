Revision history for Perl extension Sereal-Decoder

0.31 Sun Feb 17 15:06 2013 (AMS time)
  - Daniel Dragan <bulk88@hotmail.com> spent a bunch of time
    digging into the weird problems we were having with Snappy
    encoded data on Windows on certain builds. Turned out that
    it was right broken, and worked sometimes purely by chance.
    He kindly provided a patch.

0.30 Wed Feb 09 06:24 2013 (AMS time)
  - dummy release to keep in sync with encoder.

0.29 Sat Feb 09 18:09 2013 (AMS time)
  - Change a gcc'ism, #warning to #pragma message
    (which also works on my machines gcc)

0.28 Sat Feb 09 16:20 2013 (AMS time)
  - More fixups for building on Win32/C89 compilers
  - Fix up handling of regexps on perl 5.10.1

0.27 Sat Feb 09 12:58 2013 (AMS time)
  - Various fixups to improve building on Win32
  - Fix C89 violations
  - Fixed Changelog order (why would I ever have listed oldest first?)

0.26 - unreleased

0.25 Tue Jan 22 18:00 2013
  - Various compatibility fixes with old versions of Perl.
    Specifically, fixes to regular expression handling that should help
    with 5.10 support, as well as fixes that should improve the status
    quo on 5.8.
  - Potential fix for a leak wrt. regular expression support.
  - Fewer compiler warnings on 32bit/gcc.

0.24 Thu Jan 10 08:42 2013
  - Test logic fixes: These prevented builds if the encoder wasn't
    installed (or updated) before.

0.23 Tue Jan 08 07:23 2013
  * Important bug fix release *
  - Important: support for the incremental-parsing Snappy format that
    is enabled with the encoder's (versions 0.23 and up)
    'snappy_incr' option.

0.22 - unreleased

0.21 Wed Jan 02 08:00 2013
  - Option 'max_num_hash_entries' to limit the number of accepted
    hash entries.

0.20 - unreleased

0.19  Thu Nov 23 07:00 2012
  - Add configurable recursion limit to the decoder
  - Downgrade UTF8 Sereal serialized strings before decoding them

0.18 - unreleased
0.17 - unreleased
0.16 - unreleased

0.15  Wed Oct 17 13:00 2012
  - Decoder option validate_utf8
    With this option (turned off by default for performance reasons)
    the decoder will emit an error on malformed UTF-8. This will
    *not* check for invalid code points; this can be added later, but Perls
    that are recent enough will warn on those anyway.
  - Thread-safety fix on Perls >= 5.8.7. Sereal is still not thread-safe
    on older Perls 

0.14 - unreleased

0.13  Tue Oct  2 15:00 2012
  * Important bug fix, important gotcha! *
  - Work around bug in perls <= 5.8.8:
      Multiple references to the same object that has overloading were
      dropping overloadedness on the second and following occurrence.
    => The work-around for this old perl bug means that we have to
       bless objects as we find them during deserialization. By default,
       on newer perls, we only do the bless()ing once after being done
       with serialization. We normally do this for security reasons
       (destructors!). This means that for perls <= 5.8.8, we necessarily
       have the same (very limited) security problem that Storable has
       at all times. Sucks, but better to have it working on 5.8.8 at all.
    => For newer perls, we DO NOT have that security problem!
    => The work-around also slows down operation on 5.8.8 and older. Keep
       that in mind when comparing serialization techniques. Thank you.

0.12 - unreleased

0.11  Tue Sep 18 13:00 2012
  - 5.8.5 fixes.
  - Fixes to other languages' reference data output.

0.10  Mon Sep 17 13:40 20120
  - New 'refuse_objects' option causes the decoder to throw an
    exception when encountering objects in the input data.
    See the "ROBUSTNESS" section in the documentation for why that
    is a good idea.
  - Fixes to error messages.
  - Compiler warning fixes.

0.09  Fri Sep 14 09:40 2012
  - Removes use of variadic macros for compatibility with inferior
    compilers.
  - "looks_like_sereal" method/function for a quick way to check for
    valid Sereal *headers*.
  - More liberal set of encoder versions we run the full tests with.

0.08  Thu Sep 13 17:00 2012
  - Documentation fixes
  - Better tests

0.07  Tue Sep 11 14:00 2012
  - Improved robustness to bad input data.
  - Test fixes for threaded perls (likely working around a bug in Perl)
  - Improved documentation.

0.06  Mon Sep 10 11:00 2012
  - First public release (CPAN).
  - Beta quality software.

0.05  Fri Sep  7 14:00 2012
