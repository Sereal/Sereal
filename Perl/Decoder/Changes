0.09  Fri Sep 14 09:40 2012
  - Removes use of variadic macros for compatibility with inferior
    compilers.
  - "looks_like_sereal" method/function for a quick way to check for
    valid Sereal *headers*.
  - More liberal set of encoder versions we run the full tests with.

0.10  Mon Sep 17 13:40 20120
  - New 'refuse_objects' option causes the decoder to throw an
    exception when encountering objects in the input data.
    See the "ROBUSTNESS" section in the documentation for why that
    is a good idea.

  * Important bug fix, important gotcha! *
  - Work around bug in perls <= 5.8.8:
      Multiple references to the same object that has overloading were
      dropping overloadedness on the second and following occurrence.
    => The work-around for this old perl bug means that we have to
       bless objects as we find them during deserialization. By default,
       on newer perls, we only do the bless()ing once after being done
       with serialization. We normally do this for security reasons
       (destructors!). This means that for perls <= 5.8.8, we necessarily
       have the same (very limited) security problem that Storable has
       at all times. Sucks, but better to have it working on 5.8.8 at all.
    => For newer perls, we DO NOT have that security problem!
    => The work-around also slows down operation on 5.8.8 and older. Keep
       that in mind when comparing serialization techniques. Thank you.

0.15  Wed Oct 17 13:00 2012
  - Decoder option validate_utf8
    With this option (turned off by default for performance reasons)
    the decoder will emit an error on malformed UTF-8. This will
    *not* check for invalid code points; this can be added later, but Perls
    that are recent enough will warn on those anyway.
  - Thread-safety fix on Perls >= 5.8.7. Sereal is still not thread-safe
    on older Perls
