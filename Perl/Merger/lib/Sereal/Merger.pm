=head1 NAME

Sereal::Merger - A tool to merge Sereal documents into single one

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Sereal::Merger;

    my $merger = Sereal::Merger->new({...options...});

    $merger->append($sereal_document);
    # or
    $merger->append_all(\@sereal_documents);

    my $out = $merger->finish();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library provides a way of merging multiple Sereal documents into one.

The Sereal protocol version emitted by merger is currently protocol version 3
by default.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new

Constructor. Optionally takes a hash reference as first parameter. This hash
reference may contain any number of options that influence the behaviour of the
encoder.

Currently, the following options are recognized, none of them are on
by default.

=head3 compress

If this option provided and true, compression of the document body is enabled.
As of Sereal version 3, two different compression techniques are supported
and can be enabled by setting C<compress> to the respective named
constants (exportable from the C<Sereal::Merger> module):
Snappy (named constant: C<SRL_SNAPPY>),
and Zlib (C<SRL_ZLIB>).
For your convenience, there is also a C<SRL_UNCOMPRESSED>
constant.

=head3 max_recursion_depth

C<Sereal::Merger> is recursive. If you pass it a Perl data structure
that is deeply nested, it will eventually exhaust the C stack. Therefore,
there is a limit on the depth of recursion that is accepted. It defaults
to 10000 nested calls. You may choose to override this value with the
C<max_recursion_depth> option. Beware that setting it too high can
cause hard crashes, so only do that if you B<KNOW> that it is safe to
do so.

Do note that the setting is somewhat approximate. Setting it to 10000 may break at
somewhere between 9997 and 10003 nested structures depending on their types.

=head3 dedupe_strings

If this is option is enabled/true then Sereal will use a hash to encode
duplicates of strings during merging. This has a performance and memory penalty
during merging so it defaults to off.  On the other hand, data structures with
many duplicated strings will see a significant reduction in the size of the
encoded form. Currently only strings longer than 3 characters will be deduped,
however this may change in the future.

=head3 protocol_version

Specifies the version of the Sereal protocol to emit. Valid are integers
between 1 and the current version. If not specified, the most recent protocol
version will be used.

=head3 top_level_element

This option specifies what objects will be used as top level container for merged documents. There are three available options:

=over 4

SCALAR - not really a coninter. Mostly used for testing purposes.
Exported as SRL_TOP_LEVEL_SCALAR.

=back

=over 4

ARRAY - default option. The result of merging is eqvivalent to:

    my @data = (...documents...);
    my $encoded = encoder_sereal([ @data ]);

Exported as SRL_TOP_LEVEL_ARRAY.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 append

Merge provided Sereal document. If the document is invalid, the method throws
exception. However, it's garanteed that the result of previos merging operation
will not be affected.

=head2 append_all

Same as C<append>, but expects ArrayRef as input. If ArrayRef contains invalid
Sereal document an excetion is thrown. However, it's garanteed that
C<Sereal::Merger> preserves consistent internal state. Merging operation can be
continued. The index where merging failed to be obtained via
C<elements_merged>.

=head2 finish

Finalize merging operation. The output of this function is valid Sereal document.

=head2 elements_merged

Return number of merged documents.
