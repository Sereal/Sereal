    of csnappy or miniz. Thanks to Petr Písař <ppisar@redhat.com>

3.002 Aug 20 2014
  Summary of changes from 3.001 - 3.002
  - Introduce "canonical" option to encoder
  - Introduce "canonical_refs" option to encoder

  * Test Infra Changes
  - Split up bulk tests to speed up testing and make it easier
    to see when a failure is restricted to a specific option.

  * Big-Endian Support
  - Improved support for Big-Endian machines. We now build and pass test
    on Sparc and HP-UX and other platforms with big-endian or strict
    alignedness requirements. Much thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi,
    Gregor Herrmann, and H. Merijn Brand for for their assistance with
    this.
  - We still have issues with s390x (Z/Os) with Sereal. If someone wants
    to help it would be appreciated.

3.001
  - Upgrade to version 3 of the protocol
    * Add Zlib compression support to the protocol
    * Add Zlib support to Encoder/Decoder
    * Add CANONICAL_UNDEF tag to represent PL_sv_undef
    * Change magic header so it is trivial to detect
      and reject utf8 encoded Sereal packets.
  - Change how we serialize variables which have more
    than one of IOK, NOK, and POK set. In general we
    favour the numeric form, with the exception of when
    all three are set when we favour the string form
    (this is to handle engineering notation like "0E0"
    where numeric and string equivalence may differ)
