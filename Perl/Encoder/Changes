0.07  Tue Sep 11 14:00 2012
  - "undef_unknown" option will cause unsupported Perl types to be
    encoded as "undef" instead of throwing an exception.
  - Similarly, "stringify_unknown" will make those unsupported types
    be stringified instead. The two options are mutually exclusive.
  - "warn_unknown" option (only meaningful if "stringify_unknown" or
    "undef_unknown" are active) will cause a warning to be issued when
    an unsupported type is encoded as a string or as undef.
  - Bug fixes for encoding the contents of tied hashes (the tiedness
    itself is not preserved by design).
  - Solaris build fix.
  - Test fixes for threaded perls (likely working around a bug in Perl
  - Improved documentation.

  * Important bug fix *
  - Under certain circumstances, an encoder object could be left
    in an unclean state when an encoding operation failed via
    an exception.

0.13 - unreleased

0.14  Wed Oct 10 11:11 2012
  - The 'warn_unknown' option now optionally does NOT emit a warning
    if the unsupported item is a blessed object with string overloading.

  - Thread-safety fix on Perls >= 5.8.7. Sereal is still not thread-safe

  - Re-entrancy fix for obscure cases like calling into Sereal from
    $SIG{__DIE__} if the exception was thrown from within Sereal.
    (A bit of a "don't do that" case)

0.17  Mon Oct 29 12:00 2012
  * This release contains critical bug fixes *
  - Fix pointer-stashing-broken-by-realloc-from-under-it problem by
    using offsets instead.
    This bug could cause you Perl to segfault.

  * This release contains critical bug fixes *
  - Fix output data corruption in encoder when serializing an incompatible
    data structure with refcount > 1 with the "stringify_unknown" option.
