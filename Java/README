Java1.6 required.

Run the decoder on a single file:
java6 -cp bin/ com.booking.sereal.Example ../Perl/test_data/test_data_00659
(loglevel FINE tells you about every tag and byte)

Run it on all files to see a useful report for developing:
java6 -cp bin/ com.booking.sereal.Example ../Perl/test_data

Working with Eclipse is strongly recommended, but if you don't want
to: make sure everything is compiled to the bin/ directory and that it
is on your classpath
